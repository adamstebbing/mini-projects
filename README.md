**TurtleDraw.py** is a Sierpinski Triangle generator which uses the Turtle library from the Python Standard Library.

**BoredlessTourist.py** is a basic program that takes tourist information and outputs information about a given city from a preconfigured database in the program (based off CodeAcademy project).

**FoodFranchises.py** is a simple program designed to test and utilize Python objects and classes (based off a CodeAcademy project).

**ThreadShed.py** is a basic program that modifies a very long string standardized output and breaks the information down in to understandable and utilizeable segments. Used to test understanding of Python string manipulation (based off a CodeAcademy project).

**TowersOfHanoi.py** is a command line game built around it's classic namesake. Used to test understanding of Python input and stack-based structures (based off a CodeAcademy project).

**BasicKeylogger.py** is a simple GUI that while open outputs keyboard and mouse events to the command line. Used to to test understanding of events and Python's Tkinter GUI (based off a YouTube video).

**AdvancedKeylogger.py** is a more advanced program that is designed to run in the background and record keyboard actions locally until it can be exfiltrated to a programmed email account. Used to test more advanced Python design and email libraries (based off a YouTube video). Note: The fromAddr and fromPswd can either be created in a seperate Config.py file or at the beginning of the program (just be sure to get rid of 'import config').
